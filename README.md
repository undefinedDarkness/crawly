# ü¶Ä Crawly
A web crawler in your browser, This is an extension that when run on a websites, crawls all the links from the page and crawls the links, creating a graph

This is mainly for fun and if you want to answer the question how interconnected is the web really?, Could also be used for site discovery 

## INSTALLATION & USAGE
TODO, Sorry

## DEV
Currently uses Bun as it's build system but everything is in typescript so it should be fine, Code is pretty üçù though

## TODO
1. Map domains
2. Work on mapping links
3. Work off user history & procedurally add nodes to graphs
4. Find where servers are and draw them on a globe
5. Group up big company services to prevent them from infesting the graph, as in Google, Microsoft, Amazon etc.
